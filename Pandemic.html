As 2020 comes to a close, the pandemic has not abated, but mass vaccination campaigns now underway spell the early beginnings of an end now possible to foretell ‚Äî more imminent for some countries than for others.
Major coronavirus news bookended the year. An onslaught of developments punctuated the intervening months, each event often eclipsing the one before it. Here is a look back at some of the key moments that held the world‚Äôs attention as the pandemic unfolded.</p>

<h3 id="january-virus-detected-in-wuhan">JANUARY: Virus detected in Wuhan</h3>

<p>At the beginning of January, as the busy Lunar New Year travel season approached, concerns begin to percolate about a pneumonia-like virus thought to be linked to an animal market in Wuhan. The unidentified illness has afflicted dozens, according to health officials, but it‚Äôs not yet clear how it spreads, or how contagious it is. Taiwan, Hong Kong, South Korea, Thailand and the Philippines announce plans to scan travelers for symptoms and set up quarantine zones.</p>
<hr />

<p><img src="/images/h.jpeg#mid" alt="hajj" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />

<p>Cases in Wuhan, a city of more than 11 million, continue to climb. Officials scramble to contain and learn about the outbreak, which had taken the lives of at least nine people in all of China, by imposing quarantine measures and rules on travel from the city.</p>

<p>By the end of the month, Chinese authorities had imposed a strict lockdown affecting more than 30 million people. Holed-up Wuhan residents experience cabin fever, while the rest of the world looks on with trepidation, at early inklings of what the future might hold.</p>

<p>The virus has already traveled far.</p>

<h3 id="march">March</h3>

<p>In March, all hell broke loose. But under the shadow of a pandemic, hell isn‚Äôt a clattering sturm und drang. It‚Äôs eerie silence and empty spaces. It‚Äôs people dying alone in quarantined hospital beds. Global markets shuddered, sputtered and crashed, foreshadowing months of economic suffering.</p>

<p>As shutdowns rolled across the globe, life as we knew it seemed to grind to a halt overnight: Empty flights, deserted city centers, and cruise ships floating listlessly though the open water, their trapped passengers hoping in vain for a place to port.</p>

<h1 id="who-intervention">WHO intervention</h1>
<p>On March 11, the World Health Organization called the coronavirus what it is and what it will remain for months: A pandemic. For weeks afterward, little else seems to matter.
‚ÄúIf you are healthy, you only need to wear a mask if you are taking care of a person with suspected #coronavirus infection,‚Äù the World Health Organization tweets on March 1, as</p>

<p>In the United States, health officials give similar advice.</p>

<p>‚ÄúOne of the things people shouldn‚Äôt be doing, the general public, is going out and buying masks,‚Äù said U.S. Surgeon General Jerome Adams. ‚ÄúIt actually does not help, and it has not been proven to be effective in preventing the spread of coronavirus amongst the general public.‚Äù</p>

<p>The comments come as some countries, including the United States, face mask shortages for front-line workers. Health officials eventually backtrack and recommend fabric face coverings to block respiratory droplets in public. But the confusing advice sets the stage for masks to become a divisive issue in the United States.</p>

<h1 id="march-8-lockdown-in-italy">March 8 :Lockdown in Italy</h1>

<p>As cases and deaths soar in northern Italy, Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte announces a lockdown affecting about 16 million people. The restrictions mark the toughest steps taken outside of China. Other countries in Europe, including Spain and France, follow with their own shutdowns.

<p>In Italy, hospital beds fill with coronavirus patients. Doctors fall ill. Medical students matriculate early and health-care workers come out of retirement to fill staffing gaps. The world watches for lessons on what major outbreaks outside China might look like and how governments might respond.</p>

<p>For nearly two months, Italians are confined to their homes, raising questions about how far Western democracies can go in their restriction of civil liberties for public health purposes.</p>

<p>With more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and 4,291 people dead, the WHO declares the coronavirus a pandemic.</p>

<p>South Africa imposes a national lockdown after becoming the first African country to confirm more than 1,000 cases of the virus.</p>

<p>President Cyril Ramaphosa sends army personnel across the country of 57 million people to enforce the measure, which bans all movement apart from grocery shopping, walking alone, collecting welfare grants and seeking health care. The shutdown would come to span months, becoming one of Africa‚Äôs strictest.</p>

<p>While the virus‚Äôs spread sparks concerns on a continent with health infrastructures more fragile than China‚Äôs and Europe‚Äôs, which buckled under pressure, life continues to look much like normal in many parts of the continent.</p>

<h3 id="april">April</h3>

<p>Worldwide coronavirus cases hit 1 million at the beginning of April. By the end of the month, there were 1 million cases in the United States alone.
People ‚Äî and economies ‚Äî can‚Äôt stay locked down forever. In April, widespread coronavirus restrictions began to chafe, and groups of Americans took to the streets in protest, demanding a return to normalcy.</p>

<p>But normal was already long gone. Face masks became a familiar sight, and social distancing became a way of life.Our ‚Äúnew normal‚Äù involved face masks and social distancing.</p>

<p>Worldwide coronavirus cases hit 1 million at the beginning of the month. By the end of April there were 1 million cases in the United States alone, and more than 62,000 deaths worldwide. Federal social-distancing guidelines also expired, leaving states to chart their own path forward despite clear signs that the threat was far from over.</p>

<p>But the restrictions didn‚Äôt sit well with everyone. In the United States, various groups took to the streets in protest, demanding a return to normalcy.</p>

<hr />

<h3 id="may">May</h3>

<p>In May, rumblings of a different kind of unrest began to surface in the Georgia town of Brunswick, where a Black man named Ahmaud Arbery had been shot and killed while jogging in a neighborhood in February. The case echoed painful memories of other unarmed Black men who had died at the hands of police or, in Arbery‚Äôs case, men allegedly pursuing some form of vigilante justice.</p>

<p>One racial crisis was quickly compounded with another when George Floyd, an unarmed Black man, was killed during an encounter with police in Minneapolis later that month ‚Äî an encounter that was caught on video as an officer kneeled on his neck for nearly nine minutes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the floodgates were opened. Streets left barren during weeks of coronavirus lockdowns were filled night after night with thousands of protesters calling for justice, police accountability and reform. Clashes between demonstrators and police only added to the tensions, and before the month was over, it was clear a reckoning was going to come.</p>

<p>All the while, the specter of the coronavirus still hung over the world. Countries began tentatively reopening. For the first time since December, China recorded its first day without a new case. However, the reprieve was to be short-lived.</p>

<p>In the United States, there was barely a reprieve at all. On May 27, the US recorded its 100,000th coronavirus death.</p>

<p><img src="/images/prot.jpg#mid" alt="hajj" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />

<p style="text-align: center;padding-top:2px">Protesters have been rallying across the United States since the death of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. Anger poured through communities as video of Floyd's last moments began circulating. Floyd was pleading for help as he was pinned down, saying he couldn't breathe. The demonstrations have been largely peaceful, but some cities have seen instances of violence, with protesters clashing with police and stores being looted and burned.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>‚ÄúEverything was happening so quickly. Everyone was dying so quickly. We had to go from one death to another and the next. I was imagining it happening to my family and being in a situation like that.‚Äù <br />

</blockquote>

<h1 id="june">June</h1>

<p>The protests sparked by George Floyd‚Äôs death roared into June and went global. Demonstrators filled city centers in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Brazil, Australia, South Africa and countless other countries, uniting under one refrain: Black Lives Matter.</p>

<p>In the United States, talks of police reform rippled through Congress. Cities slashed police department budgets and tightened police accountability. People also took change into their own hands, toppling statues of men who once championed or traded in slavery. Confederate flags and other symbols of racial enmity came down, too.</p>

<p>With the 2020 election mere months away, President Trump returned to the campaign trail, hosting one of his signature rallies in Tulsa, Oklahoma.</p>

<p>After a few weeks of optimism, coronavirus cases came roaring back across the globe. In the United States, experts warned premature reopenings may have sent the country hurtling toward another round of calamity and death.</p>

<p><img src="/images/prot3.jpg#mid" alt="hajj" class="img-responsive" /></p>
<hr />

<p>Protesters hold up their phones during a demonstration outside the White House on June 3. George Floyd‚Äôs death has reignited a national conversation about race, police brutality and social injustice. There have been calls to defund the police, and protesters have been tearing down statues of men who once championed or traded in slavery.</p>

<p>Demonstrators set fire to a Wendy‚Äôs restaurant in Atlanta on June 13. Rayshard Brooks, a 27-year-old Black man, was fatally shot by police near the restaurant‚Äôs drive-thru on June 12. Brooks was shot after police moved to handcuff him for suspected driving under the influence, according to videos from the scene. The videos show that Brooks took an officer‚Äôs Taser during the attempted arrest and then fired the Taser at the officers as he ran away. One officer then fatally shot Brooks three times with his service weapon, authorities said. Brooks was shot twice in the back, according to a release by the Fulton County Medical Examiner‚Äôs Office. The police officer who killed Brooks, Garrett Rolfe, was fired and charged with murder. Rolfe‚Äôs attorneys say Rolfe was legally justified and acting in self-defense. Atlanta‚Äôs police chief resigned</p>

<p>The Saudi government enforces health restrictions that make the pilgrimage all the more unusual: holy water is bottled instead of drawn from a communal well, stones to be symbolically hurled at the devil come pre-sanitized and worshipers wear masks as they walk around the Kaaba.</p>

<p>Although the pandemic is worse in the United States than it ever has been, other states and cities decline to do the same. Some implement rules on indoor dining or gatherings, but nothing matching the restrictions of the spring.</p>

<hr />

<p>The year thus ended not with the end of the pandemic but another wave of stern security measures. The hopes of a fresh new year was lost.But still we must believe that the situation will improve and we can return to our normal lives again.Do keep your hopes alive for normal will return.</p>
