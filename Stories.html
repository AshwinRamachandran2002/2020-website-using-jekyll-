                        <p> 2020 saw one of the largest period of bushfires in Australia causing an estimated 300 billion dollar loss
                            in property and environmental damages. An estimated 2000 animals have lost their habitats
                        and the world saw one of the most evident cause of climate change.Beginning in June 2019, 
                        hundreds of bushfire ravaged southeast Australia through the summer months. The Australian state of 
                        New South Wales was declared unsafe on this day as thousands of residents were evacuated from the region. 
                        The following day, Victoria also announced a state of disaster as 28 people were left unaccounted for. 
                        According to a Jan. 10 report by Canberra Times, 27 people were killed and over 2,100 homes were destroyed. 
                        Some reports revealed that the fire has damaged over 988,421 acres (400,000 hectares) of Victorian land. </p>

                        <p>Shortly after taking off from Tehran, Iran, a Kiev-bound Ukraine International Airlines Boeing 737 crashed, killing all 176 on board. After denying initially, the Iranian government said that it shot down the passenger vessel “unintentionally.” Revolutionary Guards aerospace commander Brig-Gen Amir Ali Hajizadeh told the media that the plane was mistaken for a “cruise missile” and was shot down by a short-range missile that exploded near it. Iran President Hassan Rouhani described the crash as an “unforgivable mistake.” As a result of the disaster, mass protests broke out in Iran calling for the removal of Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei. </p>

                        </header>
                        <p> George Floyd, an African American man, died while in police custody in Minneapolis, Minnesota, U.S. In a video that went viral, police officer Derek Chauvin can be seen pressing his knee on Floyd’s neck to restrain him while he was pinned to the ground. The action, which lasted several minutes, was marked by Floyd’s call for help, repeating the phrase “I can’t breathe.” He was taken to the Hennepin County Medical Center but was declared dead. His death led to protests against police brutality in the Minneapolis–Saint Paul region, which were peaceful at first but soon turned violent as several public and private properties were vandalized demonstrators clashed with protestors. The demonstrations in the U.S. have since spiraled into global outrage, with supporters gathering publicly to protest police violence against people of color, and deep-seated racism in society more generally.  </p>

                        <p> Even though the Beirut blast only happened in August, it feels like an absolute lifetime ago. 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate had been stored in a warehouse at Beirut's port without proper safety measures for six years, and while the exact cause of the detonation is still under investigation, there had been a fire at the warehouse preceding the blast, which caused at least 204 deaths, 6,500 injuries, billions of dollars' worth of property damage, and left an estimated 300,000 people homeless. It is considered one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosions in history.   </p>

                        </header>
                        <p> For many Hong Kongers Jimmy Lai is a hero, a rare tycoon who has dared to challenge the soaring influence of Beijing. That's why the mass raid on his publication Apple Daily - Hong Kong's biggest pro-democracy newspaper - stunned the city.
                            It started with Mr Lai's arrest early on 10 August.The outspoken media mogul was no stranger to arrest. But this time it came under the controversial new national security law imposed by China - where he's viewed as a traitor - that could see the 73-year-old jailed for life.
                            More than 200 police officers searched his paper's headquarters as Mr Lai himself was paraded through the newsroom in unprecedented scenes livestreamed by its reporters.
                            Early the next morning Hong Kongers queued up at news stands across the city to buy the tabloid, which vowed to "fight on" in a defiant headline.
                            Earlier this month he was formally charged for endangering national security - led to court in handcuffs and a metal chain.
