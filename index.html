										In June it literally went up in smoke.
										Pyongyang blew up the building, saying it wanted "human scum and those who have sheltered the scum to pay dearly for their crimes".
										That was a reference to defectors in the South, who for years have sent propaganda leaflets into the North, usually by balloon or bottles in rivers.
										The building itself - launched to great fanfare in 2018 on Pyongyang's side of the militarised border - had been empty since January due to Covid-19.
										But the dramatic and carefully choreographed explosion still reverberated around the world.
										It was a clear sign of Pyongyang's fury and, as one analyst put it, marked "an ominous turning point for the two neighbours".
